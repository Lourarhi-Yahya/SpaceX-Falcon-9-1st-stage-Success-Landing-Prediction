SpaceX Falcon-9 Successful Landing Prediction

Introduction

In this capstone project, we aim to predict whether the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land after launch. The significance lies in the cost-saving factor of reusing the first stage, which allows SpaceX to offer launches at a significantly lower cost compared to competitors. By determining the success of landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch and potentially assist other companies in bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.

Data Collection and Wrangling

We will employ a combination of web scraping and utilizing a RESTful API to gather data. This data will then be converted into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis. Our Jupyter notebook will be shared on GitHub to ensure accessibility and collaboration.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our EDA phase involves crafting scatter plots and bar charts to delve into the data. We'll harness Python's Pandas library to manipulate the data efficiently. Additionally, SQL queries will be written to filter and sort the data. Visualizations will play a pivotal role in uncovering insights and patterns from the data.

Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards

This segment involves the creation of interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash. These dashboards will encompass pie charts and scatter plots to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the launch records. Furthermore, we will employ the Folium library to build interactive maps, enabling us to analyze the proximity of launch sites.

Predictive Analysis (Classification)

Machine learning will take center stage as we aim to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing. Our dataset will be divided into training and testing data sets. Different classification models, including SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression, will be trained. Hyperparameter grid search will aid in optimizing model performance. The ultimate goal is to determine the most effective method by evaluating performance on the test data.

Conclusion

This capstone project amalgamates various aspects of data science, from data collection to predictive modeling. By accurately predicting the success of Falcon 9's first stage landing, we contribute to cost estimation and informed decision-making in the field of rocket launches.
